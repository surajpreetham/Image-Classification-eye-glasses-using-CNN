# Image-Classification-eye-glasses-using-CNN
Classify the images with glasses and no glasses using Convolutional Neural Networks

The objective of this notebook is to classify the Image with eye glasses and no glasses using Convolutional neural networks

Using Data augmentation techniques, the image data is increased and it is sent to model to classify anf identify the images if there are eye glasses.
